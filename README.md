# CodeTech IT Solution Internship Task Documentation: Weather Web App

This documentation provides an overview of the Weather Web App project developed as part of the CodeTech IT Solution internship task. The project is a simple weather web application that allows users to check the weather conditions of any city. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the user's input. Additionally, it uses the OpenCageData Geocoder to determine the user's location based on their coordinates and fetches weather data accordingly.

## Features

- **Search Functionality:** Users can enter the name of a city in the search bar and press Enter or click the search button to get the weather information for that city.
- **Automatic Location Detection:** If the user grants location access, the application automatically detects their current location and displays the weather information for that location.
- **Weather Information Display:** The application displays the current temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed for the chosen location.
- **Background Image Update:** The background image of the application changes dynamically based on the searched or detected location, enhancing the user experience.
